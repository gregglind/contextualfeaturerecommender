## What prompted Mozilla to run this test?

We believe that users want a Firefox that is customized to their needs. Creating the right UI to do this in a way that feels timely, but non-invasive is hard.  This experiment implements several kinds and contexts of notification about potential customizations.

Data collected from this test will be used to inform many uncoming features relating to repair, support, and customizaton modes.
